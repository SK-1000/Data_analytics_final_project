Running a Streamlit app is similar to running any Python script.
All you need to do is use the "streamlit run Home.py" command in command line to see the app run locally. 


You can use the following creditionals to log in for review purposes:

Username skirwan
password ghi

or any of the other credentials in the config.yaml file.

The file to be inputted to this app for analysis is stored in the github repositary also. It is called RandomGeneratedEventDataFile.csv

The external version of the website can be viewed by clicking on this URL.

Not all features of the app work successsfully on this deployed version. I suggest viewing this Streamlit app locally to examine all features.
